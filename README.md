Hazelcast Simulator
===========================

A production simulator for stress testing Hazelcast and Hazelcast based applications in clustered environments. This
can be in a local machine, but can also be in a cloud like EC2 or Google Compute Engine. The Simulator makes use of
Apache jclouds&reg;, so in theory we can roll out in any cloud.

Simulator includes a test suite for our own stress simulation, but you can fork this repo, and add your own.

Commercially we offer support agreements where we will integrate your tests into our runs for new releases so that your
tests act as an Application TCK.
