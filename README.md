hazelcast-stabilizer
===========================

A production simulator for stress testing Hazelcast and Hazelcast based applications in clustered environments. This can be in a local machine, but can also be in a cloud like EC2 or Google Compute Engine. The Stabilizer makes use of JClouds, so in theory
we can roll out in any cloud.

Stabilizer includes a test suite for our own stress simulation, but you can fork this repo, and add your own. 

Commerically we offer support agreements where we will integrate your tests into our runs for new releases so that your tests act as an Application TCK.
