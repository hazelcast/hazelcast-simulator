# Script to install Hazelcast
# 
# The installation can be modified by copying it into the working directory.
# All properties from the 'simulator.properties' are passed as environment variables.
#
# TODO
# - use rsync instead of scp for upload
# - driver-lib git: enterprise
#
# IDEAS
# - instead of download artifacts to local machine and then uploading; download them on the target machine
# - instead of uploading to each machine, upload to a single machine and then download from that machine
