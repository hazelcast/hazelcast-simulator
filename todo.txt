TODO

- VERSION_SPEC to version

- delete ExecuteScriptMessage

- seems that the hazelcast jars are always uploaded even when there is no change.

- get the right param files in the workers directory

- lite member: what should be name of config file

- remove client type from coordinator cli

- [Fatal Error] log4j.xml:3:22: The prefix "log4j" for element "log4j:configuration" is not bound.

- properly fix log4j.xml

- properly fix worker.sh

- undesirable driver upload output

- remove the driver parameters from the Java code.

DONE

- don't log the coordinatorcli command because of params noise
    - cause is in the worker plan

- null
