- with litemember I get following failure
com.hazelcast.simulator.utils.CommandLineExitException: Could not locate driver class [com.hazelcast.simulator.hazelcast4plus.Hazelcast4PlusDriver]

- get the right param files in the workers directory

- lite member: what should be name of config file

- remove client type from coordinator cli

- remove the driver parameters from the Java code.

- make DriverInstallArgs a dataclass

- make DriverConfigureArgs a dataclass

- driver install should be optional

- driver configure should be optional

- fix driver args problems

- rename driverinstall to driverinstallargs

- introduce a driver install config

- introduce a driver configure config

- move agents_upload_driver into driver

- move driver call to driver

- introduce driver utils or something
