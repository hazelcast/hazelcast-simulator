- configure copy hazelcast.xml

- configure copy hazelcast-client.xml

- properly locate worker.sh in configure

- properly locate log4j.xml in configure

- the worker config directory needs to be passed as property

- the member args need to be passed as coordinator property

- the client args need to be passed as coordinator property

- better name for worker_config_dir

- final_worker_params_dir: better name

- [Fatal Error] log4j.xml:3:22: The prefix "log4j" for element "log4j:configuration" is not bound.

- properly fix log4j.xml

- properly fix worker.sh

- hazelcast 3 install fix

- client type

- fail fast

- undesirable driver upload output

- read out nodes driver with defaulting

- read out nodes driver version with defaulting

- read out load generators driver version with defaulting

- read out load generators driver version with defaulting

- creation of the final Hazelcast config files through the install script

- uploading of the final Hazelcast config files

DONE

- config logic needs to go to config script

- in the worker output directory, make subdirs with their content for 'target'

- copy log4j.xml to worker output dir

- copy worker.sh to worker output dir


- update agents_upload_driver.py to new format

- driver-hazelcast5 not uploaded: the agents_upload_driver script is not called

- remove upload_hazelcast_jars.py

- hack in log4j.xml

- hack in worker.sh

- fix:  cause=com.hazelcast.simulator.agent.workerprocess.CreateWorkerFailedException:
Startup of Worker A1_W1 on Agent 18.185.56.223 failed,
check log files in /home/ubuntu/hazelcast-simulator/workers/93b2cef18fe4fc7cd8e9244ada7edeb169d93132/A1_W1-18.185.56.223-member for more information!

- Could not create member Worker A1_W1, reason: Cannot invoke "String.replace(char, char)" because "versionSpec" is null

- benchmark directory 'runs/read_only/26-02-2024_15-24-36' does not exist!

- DRIVER=null

- uploading of the Hazelcast jars through the install script

- todo: fix hardcoded driver in worker

- Could not create member Worker A1_W1, reason: Cannot invoke "String.contains(java.lang.CharSequence)" because "driver" is null

- coordinator can't deal with node driver

- coordinator can't deal with load generator driver

- no explicit walking over the properties in perfrest.py

- coordinator cli: processing of the list of properties and append to the deployment plan

- simulator properties need to be added to plan

- no explicit license key parameter

- adding all the properties to the coordinator cli

- configure the run path
    Too many TestSuite files specified: [hazelcast5, /tmp/perftest_mxkg_gvu.txt]

- Could not create member Worker A1_W1, reason: dirname can't be null

- add node driver to coordinator cli

- add load generator driver to coordinator cli

- add logic for the loadgenerator and node driver in the perftest.py

- com.hazelcast.simulator.utils.CommandLineExitException: Could not locate driver class [com.hazelcast.simulator.hazelcast4plus.Hazelcast4PlusDriver]

- the coordinator is still failing

- installation of the load generators is missing

- does the coordinator driver part still do the install?

- driver properties

- get the Hazelcast 4 install to run

- fix No module named 'simulator'

- driver script executable
