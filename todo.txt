TODO

- remove client type from coordinator cli

- pass path to worker.sh from test

- the files in the coordinator_params_dir need to be added as command line prop

- [Fatal Error] log4j.xml:3:22: The prefix "log4j" for element "log4j:configuration" is not bound.

- properly fix log4j.xml

- properly fix worker.sh

- undesirable driver upload output

UNSURE

- driver install should be optional

- driver configure should be optional




DONE

- configure hazelcast.xml  <!--LITE_MEMBER_CONFIG-->

- litemember 'True' problem

- configure should also get is_server setting

- specific_coordinator_props_dir = f"{coordinator_props_dir}/{inventory_host_pattern}" can lead to problems
when inventory_host pattern is not file string. Perhaps get rid of the inventory host pattern completely and pass
the right directory and no need for driver to make subdir.

- the install should only install on the configured machines; currently it will

- the install should make use of inventory.py to get the data

- configure client-hazelcast.xml <!--MEMBERS-->

- configure hazelcast.xml <!--MEMBERS-->

- can a client have a license key: no

- the worker config directory needs to be passed as property

- pass path to client_hazelcast.xml from test

- pass path to hazelcast.xml from test

- configure hazelcast.xml <!--LICENSE-KEY-->

- the member args need to be passed as coordinator property

- the client args need to be passed as coordinator property

- properly load the hazelcast.xml and client-hazelcast.xml config files

- add find driver config file

- final_worker_params_dir: better name

- better name for worker_config_dir

- properly locate worker.sh in configure

- properly locate log4j.xml in configure
