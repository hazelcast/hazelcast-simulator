             their state.

             This feature requires Hazelcast Enterprise and is implemented on top of the
             Persistence feature. Therefore you should enable and configure Persistence,
             especially the base directory where to store the recovery files.

        <!-- Sets the maximum number of records that can be accumulated by any single
             Processor instance.
             Operations like grouping, sorting or joining require certain amount of
             records to be accumulated before they can proceed. You can set this option
             to reduce the probability of OutOfMemoryError.

             This option applies to each Processor instance separately, hence the
             effective limit of records accumulated by each cluster member is influenced
             by the vertex's localParallelism and the number of jobs in the cluster.

             Currently, maxProcessorAccumulatedRecords limits:
                - number of items sorted by the sort operation
                - number of distinct keys accumulated by aggregation operations
                - number of entries in the hash-join lookup tables
                - number of entries in stateful transforms
                - number of distinct items in distinct operation

             Note: the limit does not apply to streaming aggregations.
