# Hazelcast Simulator ‚Äì Existing Cluster Template

This template is designed to run Hazelcast Simulator on an existing cluster. It allows you to run performance tests without provisioning new infrastructure.

## üîê SSH Access Requirement

Ensure that your SSH public key (`key.pub`) is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on **load generators**. This is required for passwordless SSH access.

## Modify the Environment

Edit the `inventory.yaml` file to specify your loadgenerator setup:
- IP addresses and SSH users for `loadgenerators`

Edit the `client-hazelcast.xml` file to to point to your Hazelcast cluster::
- Under the <cluster-members> section, list the IP addresses and ports of your Hazelcast member nodes.
- Update the <cluster-name> element to match the name of your Hazelcast cluster

##¬†Install Dependencies
Install Java and the Hazelcast Simulator on the configured instances:

```bash
inventory install java
inventory install simulator
```

## Tune the Environment
To optimize the environment for performance:

```bash
inventory tune
```
## Configure and Run Tests
Modify the tests by editing the tests.yaml file.

To run the performance tests:

```bash
perftest run
```

## Example inventory.yaml

```yaml
loadgenerators:
  hosts:
    34.243.39.233:
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: key
      ansible_user: root
      private_ip: 172.31.6.117
```
