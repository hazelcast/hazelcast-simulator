# Using asynchronous load generation.
#
# So instead of having thread per request, a concurrency level is specified. And the load
# generator will keep that number of concurrent request using the IMap async methods.
# With synchronous load generation, the clients can quickly become a bottleneck, especially
# when testing high throughput due to context switching. With async load generation this is much less
# if a problem since there are fewer threads involved. So they are a much better alternative to do
# throughput testing.
