# Cloud credentials
# =====================================================================
#
# The cloud identity (AWS access key ID).
#
# The cloud identity can be configured in two was:
#    1: using a file reference. So you set the path to the file containing the cloud identity. This is
#       the prefered way because it is more secure. Normally you put this file in your home dir
#    2: using the value. This is the simplest way, but you need to be careful that this doesn't leave
#       your system. E.g. because it got added to a git repo, zipped etc.
#
#
CLOUD_IDENTITY=~/ec2.identity

#
# The cloud credential (AWS secret access key).
#
# It can be configured in the same way as CLOUD_IDENTITY using direct value or file reference.

# Just a prefix for the agent name. Different test clusters could be given different names. In GCE you need
# to be very careful using multiple executionGroup-names, because for every port and every executionGroup-name a firewall rule is
# made and you can only have 100 firewall rules.
#
# If the name contains ${username}, this section will be replaced by the actual user that runs the
# test. This makes it very easy to identity which user is owning a certain machine.

# EC2:
# If the security group doesn't exist, it will automatically be created. If you did not specify

# GCE:
# The value is not relevant.

#
# EC2:
# You can specify VPC subnet ID. If SUBNET_ID is different than 'default' then machines are created in EC2 VPC and

# Hardware and OS selection
# =====================================================================
#
# For the options that can be set on the spec check the following link:
# http://javadocs.jclouds.cloudbees.net/org/jclouds/compute/domain/TemplateBuilderSpec.html
#
# Operating system and version can be selected using:
#   osVersionMatches=[String]
#   os64Bit=[boolean]
#   osArchMatches=[String]
#   osDescriptionMatches=[String]
# For list of available operating systems see:
# http://javadocs.jclouds.cloudbees.net/org/jclouds/compute/domain/OsFamily.html
#
# Examples:
#       osFamily=UBUNTU,osVersionMatches=12.04
#       osFamily=CENTOS
#       osFamily=RHEL,os64Bit
#       osDescription=.*Ubuntu 12.04.*
#
# A specific AMI can also be selected using an imageId e.g.
#
#       imageId=us-east-1/ami-fb8e9292
#
# Warning:
#       If you want to use RHEL, use the following ami us-east-1/ami-1b3b2472.
#       The ones listed in EC2 are not working; jclouds messes up with the account initialization.
#
# Hardware can be selected e.g.
# MACHINE_SPEC=minCores=2,minRam=2048
#
# You can also explicitly set the hardware id, e.g. on EC2:
# hardwareId=m1.small.
#
# For a full listing of hardware ids on EC2, check the following link
# http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?instance-types.html
#
# To set a specific region, use locationId, e.g. locationId=us-east-1a.
# The security group will be created in the location specified.
#
# Some useful regions are:
# EU (Ireland) Region	eu-west-1
# Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region	ap-southeast-2
# US East (Northern Virginia) Region	us-east-1
# US West (Northern California) Region	us-west-1
#
# The default region is us-east-1
# The default AMI is Amazon Linux AMI 2016.09.1 (HVM), SSD Volume Type
#
MACHINE_SPEC=hardwareId=c3.xlarge,imageId=us-east-1/ami-0b33d91d

#
# EC2 Instance Storage
#
# If you specify an EC2 hardwareId with an ephemeral device the Provisioner will create a filesystem and mount it automatically.
# You can override the default mkfs and mount options with the following properties.
#
# The default options are optimized for SSD devices.
#
INSTANCE_STORAGE_MKFS_OPTIONS=-t ext4 -E nodiscard
INSTANCE_STORAGE_MOUNT_OPTIONS=defaults,nofail,discard,noatime,relatime

# =====================================================================
# Hazelcast Version Configuration
# =====================================================================
#
# The workers can be configured to use a specific version of Hazelcast; so you don't need to depend on the Hazelcast
# version provided by the simulator, but you can override it with a specific version.
#
# The Hazelcast version can be configured in different ways:
#   outofthebox             : if you are fine with the one provided by the Simulator itself.
#   maven=version           : if you want to use a specific version from the maven repository, e.g.
#                                   maven=3.2
#                                   maven=3.3-SNAPSHOT
#                             Local Hazelcast artifacts will be preferred, so you can checkout e.g. an experimental
#                             branch, build the artifacts locally. This will all be done on the local machine, not
#                             on the agent machine.
#   bringmyown              : if you want to bring your own dependencies. To upload your dependencies, in the working dir, create
#                             an 'upload' directory. The content of this directory will be uploaded to the agents and automatically
#                             added to the classpath of the workers.
#   git=version             : if you want Simulator to use a specific version of Hazelcast from Git, e.g.:
#                                   git=f0288f713    to build a specific revision
#                                   git=v3.2.3       to build a version from a Git tag
#                                   git=myRepository/myBranch - to build a version from a branch in a specific repository.
#   Use GIT_CUSTOM_REPOSITORIES to specify custom repositories. The main Hazelcast repository is always named "origin".
#
VERSION_SPEC=outofthebox

# When HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC is set to Git then it will download Hazelcast sources to this directory.

#
GIT_BUILD_DIR=~/.hazelcast-build/

# Comma separated list of additional Git repositories to be fetched when HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC is set to Git.
#
# Simulator will always fetch https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast
# This property specifies additional repositories. You can use both remote and local repositories.
# Remote repositories must be accessible for anonymous, local repositories must be accessible for current user.
#
# Default value: empty, only the main Hazelcast repository is used by default.
#
#GIT_CUSTOM_REPOSITORIES=myFork=https://github.com/jerrinot/hazelcast.git,localRepo=/home/jara/devel/oss/hazelcast

# Path to a local Maven installation to use when HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC is set to Git.
