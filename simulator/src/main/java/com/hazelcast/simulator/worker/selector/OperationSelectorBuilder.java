 * Builder class to create an {@link OperationSelector} instance. Each operation is represented as an enum item and is registered
 * with its prob (0.0 to 1.0) via the {@link #addOperation(Enum, double)} method.
 *
 * The total sum of probabilities has to be exactly 1.0. You can use {@link #addDefaultOperation(Enum)} to add a default operation
 * which automatically consumes the remaining prob. The prob precision is {@value #PROBABILITY_PRECISION}.
 *
 * This builder class is not thread-safe. The created {@link OperationSelector} does not give any thread-safety guarantees. It is
 * strongly recommended to construct a new instance for each thread, at least to prevent contention on the random generator. Just
 * use a single builder and call the {@link #build()} method in each thread constructor.
