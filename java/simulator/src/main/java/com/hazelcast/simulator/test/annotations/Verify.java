 * Is placed on a method in a test so for verification. E.g. when an IAtomicLong.inc is tested, in the verify method one
 * could check if the counter of the IAtomicLong matches the actual number of increments.
 *
 * Multiple {@link Verify} methods are allowed. The {@link Verify} methods on a subclass are executed before
 * the {@link Verify} methods on a super class, however there is no ordering within the same class. This is the same
 * semantics as provided by junit. However {@link Verify} local happens before global {@link Verify}.
 *
 * The verify method(s) is called at most once per test-instance.
