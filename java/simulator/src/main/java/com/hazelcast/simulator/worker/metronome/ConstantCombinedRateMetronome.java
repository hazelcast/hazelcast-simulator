/**
 * The ConstantCombinedRateMetronome tries to make sure that requests are executed at a constant rate.
 * <p>
 * Normally with the {@link BusySpinningMetronome} or {@link SleepingMetronome} when 1 thread is blocked, it will not pick
 * up requests it should have picked up and it builds up a bubble. Once the thread is unblocked, this bubble needs to get
 * processed. Even though coordinated omission is resolved by determining the latency on the expected start time, while this
 * bubble is building up there is less load, and once the thread completes, the whole bubble needs to get processed.
 * <p>
 * With the ConstantCombinedRateMetronome this bubble is less likely to happen because as long as there is a thread available,
 * it will take over the work of the blocked threads. This way you get less bubbles and a more stable rate of requests.
